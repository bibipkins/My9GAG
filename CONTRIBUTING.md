## General rules you should comply with when creating a new PR:

1. All API-related changes should go here https://github.com/bibipkins/NineGagApiClient
2. Do not change assembly and package versions
3. Do not break existing functionality
4. At least 1 of the 3 mobile projects (UWP/Android/iOS) must build
5. If you make changes or additions to logical layer you should cover them with tests

To get your PR merged it has to be approved by me. It might take me up to 1 week to review your changes :(
